Hey everyone!

I recently embarked on a project where I analyzed the text data from our WhatsApp group chat. It was a fun dive into our conversations, filled with laughter, memes, and heartfelt moments!

### The Journey:
Exported the chat history as a .txt file from WhatsApp, cleaned up the data, and got ready to uncover some insights!

###Some of analysis plots :

### What I Found:
- Explored message frequency over time, revealing our peak activity periods (turns out we're night owls during weekends!).
- Had a blast analyzing emojis - ðŸ˜‚ was the clear winner!
- Created a word cloud to see our most common words and phrases.
- Did a sentiment analysis, discovering lots of positivity and laughter in our chats.

### Conclusion:
This project was an eye-opening glimpse into our group's dynamics and communication style. Can't wait to share some of the insights with the group and maybe explore more topics in the future!

Happy chatting!
